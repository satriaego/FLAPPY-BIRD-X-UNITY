Flappy Bird Unity Project
This is a simple Flappy Bird-style game developed using Unity. It was created as my first project to learn the fundamentals of game development with Unity.

Project Goals
Add background music to create an engaging atmosphere during gameplay.

Implement a slow-motion effect on the player’s horizontal movement (X-axis) and simultaneously slow down the pitch of the music when the game is over.

Animate the character to make the gameplay feel more dynamic and lively.

Challenges Encountered
While developing the game, I faced several challenges, particularly with managing the UI and gameplay flow:

Slow Motion Effect:
Applying slow motion to both the player’s movement and the game world when the game ends caused unintended side effects. For example, obstacle generation sped up unexpectedly during slow motion, resulting in too many obstacles appearing at once. Balancing the time scale and obstacle spawning required careful adjustments.

UI Management:
Implementing the start screen and the “play again” functionality presented significant difficulties. The main issues were ensuring that the start UI appeared only once at the beginning and that the play again UI correctly reset the game state without causing bugs or conflicts with ongoing game logic.

What I Learned
This project gave me practical experience with:

Unity’s scene and UI management systems.

Scripting game states and handling game flow transitions.

Adjusting audio properties dynamically to create immersive effects.

Troubleshooting and solving issues related to timing and UI visibility.
